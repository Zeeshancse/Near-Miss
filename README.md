# Near-Miss

Both .java file and .jar file is submitted.

Explanation:
take the k and n from user, while loop is there to make sure that values are in given range
left hand side: x power n + y power n is calculated
the value get from the above equation, take nth root of that value and we get value of 
To calculate near miss "left hand side - z power n", also calculated "(z+1) power n - left hand side"
whichever difference will be less that will be our near miss
Then calculate the relative miss
then compare relative miss with smallest miss to retrieve the smallest possible miss 
In this program long data type can be seen with many variables, purpose is to get the right values for as much combinations as we can since value gets very large as range or power n increases.
